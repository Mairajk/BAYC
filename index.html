        <h1>WELCOME TO THE BORED APE YACHT CLUB</h1>
        
        <p>
            BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital 
            collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape
             doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access
              to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to
               THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future 
               areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through 
               roadmap activation.

        <h3> FAIR DISTRIBUTION </h3>
        <h4>(BONDING CURVES ARE A PONZI)</h4>
        <p>
            There are no bonding curves here. Buying a Bored Ape 
            costs 0.08 ETH. There are no price tiers; BAYC membership
             costs the same for everyone.

        <note>
            <p>
                Note: Thirty apes are being withheld from the sale.
                These will be used for giveaways, puzzle rewards—and 
                for the creators' BAYC memberships.

            <h2> THE SPECS </h2>
            <p>Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated
                 from over 170 possible traits, including expression,
                  headwear, clothing, and more. All apes are dope,
                   but some are rarer than others.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum
                 blockchain and hosted on IPFS. (<a href="#">See Record
                      and Proof.</a>) Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.
                    </p>
             
             <p>
                To access members-only areas such as
                <a href=" #">THE BATHROOM</a>, Apeholders will need to be 
                signed into their Metamask Wallet.

        <h2> WELCOME TO THE CLUB </h2>
        <p> When you buy a Bored Ape, you're not simply buying an avatar
            or a provably-rare piece of art. You are gaining membership
            access to a club whose benefits and offerings will increase
            over time. Your Bored Ape can serve as your digital identity,
            and open digital doors for you.</p>

            <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the
             presale period is over. It contains a canvas accessible
              only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like any
               good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw,
                scrawl, or write expletives.</p>

            <p>Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the
             bathroom wall every fifteen minutes. Think of it as a
              collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere.
               A members-only canvas for the discerning minds of
